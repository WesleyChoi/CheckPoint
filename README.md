# CheckPoint
Hello!

CheckPoint is an enhanced to-do list meant to improve productivity in students to get them more habituated with scheduling. By creating a rewards system, an incentive to complete tasks and keeping track of what needs to be done is ingrained in students.

Using PHP and MySQL, CheckPoint allows both teachers to create a classroom and students to join one; teachers are able to upload tasks and assign point values to them, while students can view these tasks and complete them to earn the assigned points.

Thank you for visiting our project!
