            <h2>Hello! Welcome to CheckPoint!</h2>
            <p>With an estimated 88% of the workforce and 25-75% of college students being affected by procrastination, it seems that there is a prominent lack of organization and productivity in individualsâ€™ day-to-day lives.</p>

            <p><br>Our solution? Getting younger students more habituated with scheduling by creating a rewards system that incentivises the idea of keeping track of <b>what they need to get done.</b> 
            <br>The goal is to <b>make productivity an integrated part of students' habits</b>, that will carry on past elementary or high school.</p>
